<p>Hello. Welcome to the future website of the Stadium High School Code Club. Consider me a blank canvas to remake as you see fit.</p>

<p>Our first meeting is Monday February 23rd from 2:15 PM to 3:45 PM in Room 132. We'll then meet every Monday unless there's no school or Mr. Elstein can't make it.</p>
